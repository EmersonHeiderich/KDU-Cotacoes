# services/transportadoras/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'transportadoras' directory a Python package.
# It can be left empty or used for package-level initializations if needed.

# Optionally, you could import specific functions or classes here 
# to make them directly accessible from the package level, e.g.:
# from .btu import gera_cotacao_braspress
# from .epc import gera_cotacao_epc
# ... etc.

# However, importing them directly in the controller (cotacao_controller.py) 
# as done currently is also a common and clear approach.
